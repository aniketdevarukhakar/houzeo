HTML css Implementation
1 - Create index.html and give a styling for this HTML page I create style.css.
2 - In css wrote a code for annimations.
3 - For slider implementation, I have to included a swiper slider related files in index file.
        - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-element-bundle.min.js
        - swiper-bundle.min.css
4 - Also for map implementation, I have to include a leaflet map related files in index file.
        - https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.3/dist/leaflet.css
        - https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.3/dist/leaflet.js


There are basic implementations which I have created. 
1 - Created a static Property data of 10 items.
2 - listed that data in homepage.
3 - All properties have images. I used swiper slider for that (if any property have not provide image, then it will show default image like " No property photo available ").
4 - For property location, I used " leaflet " script for showing data on map with pointers through lalong.
